## 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.

### 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SURBHI0402/StoryMaker-generator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd random-story-generator
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 📦 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

#### 🏃 `npm start`

Run the app in the development mode. This will open the application in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code. Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

#### 🧪 `npm test`

Launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. You can use this script to run unit tests for the application. For more information on running tests, refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### 🏗️ `npm run build`

Build the app for production to the `build` folder. This command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The resulting production build is smaller and even comes with emojis for added flair.

## 📝 Usage

Once you've completed the installation steps, you can start generating random stories by simply clicking the "Generate Story" button on the app's interface.

Happy story generating! 📚✨

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
